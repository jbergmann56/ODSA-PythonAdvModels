divorce and I needed a lot of paperwork because I just paid my ex-wife directly I took money out of my account and put it directly into her account The State said I didn't pay her MY BANK gave me all

they couldn't handle The way they treat people It feel's friendly\", \"Because my wife and I had had some financial difficulties a few years ago and they made us feel human They worked with us to help us get back on our feet The branch manager and the person downtown who did the loan did not look down at us They went out of their way to help us secure that small loan It's not so much MY BANK as it is the people at the branch that I go to I've been going to that branch for 25 years before it was acquired by MY BANK and they know you by name When you go in there they are never too busy to talk to you\", \"Because of the customer service and the satisfaction I get when I go in there It doesn't seem like a very big organization so when you make a call you just talk to one person and get what you need to know\", \"Because of the dealings I have had with the top person at that location I have had two others before They know the answers and how to get into the computers to get the information I

in construction and we banked with them when it used to be First Bank and now it\\'s MY BANK We banked with them a long time until we moved away When I came back because he passed away I don\\'t know

account they're just nice to everybody I just like I went in the other day I haven't been in the new bank They treat me like when I visited Walmart Some banks don't recognize their customers My son is going to open a bank account They gave him good answers What else can I say about them?\", \"Because their tellers are very helpful and courteous It seems like I get a young lady named Carrie She's very sincere and courteous The girls over there are so nice and treat me so well I would never switch from MY BANK because of the customer service at Waynedale It's a little out of my way but I still wouldn't switch banks because of those girls They really deserve a pat on the back or an award I've been banking with them for a long time and I've never had a problem there Carrie treats me with some personal caring and consideration; they all are just caring I'm not wealthy but I think they would treat me the same as someone who is They take my banking seriously I wouldn't be surprised if I didn't get all excellent throughout the surveys\", \"Because they are always courteous to everyone I grew up in Kentucky and Indiana so I expect to be treated nicely You can ask them anything about the bank and if they don't know the answer they will get someone who can answer They greet you by name when you walk in and if you are waiting someone will come from the back counter to help you They

was there  When I had my surgery I was not able to go to the bank I made arrangements to have all the business taken care of They went out of their way to help me\", \"Because they go above and beyond what's required they're very very friendly I think they're a smaller branch and because they're smaller you know them better than a larger branch I used to live in South Bend and I went to all different branches because I was driving all over; I guess that's probably why I didn't get to know them as well They're very personable They ask if you want a cup of coffee if the water's cold And it doesn't happen often but I have trouble with walking and if there are a couple of people in line they will ask me if I need to sit\", \"Because they greet me by name They treat me like a person not a
