      "Actually we've never had any problems with them since we moved here 15 years ago We've never had any problems They've been very helpful We've opened accounts with them and they've led us in a good direction As long as I don't have any problem with them they are fine They seem to know what they are doing and I haven't had any banking problems with them of any kind\n",

      "Because all of the tellers are great in there I've been banking with them for years and my mom's been there for over 40 years They do good at that branch Never had any problems Jeff and Monique are very friendly When the tellers leave the ones that have been there for a while I get sad\n",
      "Because any time I call or go in there they are there for me 24 hours a day They get right down to the problems They answer any questions They are friendly and helpful They've never had a snobby person It's just the information they have for you and what they can do for you\n",

      "Because every time I have a problem they take care of it Terry is a good manager there I'm very satisfied I had a few issues in the past and they solved them Sometimes I've had companies draft my account and take too much They've gotten whatever paperwork I might have needed fast and helped me work it out It's just their general service they're very friendly I like them all\n",
      "Because I as shared I currently work with two other banks and the customer service and follow up was not good at all I have been at MY BANK for about three years They are outstanding I like the customer service and the feed back I like the fees and the use of online banking the way its set up I appreciate the way I'm treated in the bank They are eager to help with no hesitations and I like that\n",
      "Because I have had a bad experience at another bank and this one is the best banks that I have ever had They are really nice They always take care of everything I need to run my business For any questions I have they always help me and with anything I need They always help me with everything I really don't know what to say but they've always been really nice to me there\n",
      "Because I have never had a problem ever They've always been helpful and good to me For some reason they always know my name It's like they all know me It's easy to get to and there's no waiting I can't remember the last time I had to wait They're always friendly and well-mannered It's just excellent If I win the lottery tomorrow I'll put it in there\n",
      "Because I haven't had one problem since I've gone there If there is a problem they help me The people know me and are nice and welcoming I feel like they are the best\n",
      "Because I know all the service the people that work there We're friends We've been with them since we came to town We even got our home loan with them That's just where we bank Because they feel like family The greeter they always know my name They call to see if there is anything I need If I call to transfer funds or anything I think it's just that we know each other I used to work in a bank And I just think it's vital to have connection with your customers\n",

      "Because if I use the drive-up they know who I am They are timely when I am in line I am always satisfied When MY BANK first took over I had been with OTHER BANK for years I like it better than OTHER BANK They are always helpful and friendly I am very satisfied there\n",
      "Because I've had absolutely zero issues or concerns about their honesty or sincerity in the way they conduct their business I trust them Every time I come in they are friendly They are smiling They greet me They take care of my banking thank me and do everything they can do for me\n",
      "Because I've had bad experiences with the others and they just don't seem to care Here they seem to recognize me and know who I am One of the tellers knows I'm legally blind so when I walk in there she knows what I need what I want and she goes to it right away She knows what accounts I have and she asks me which one I want\n",
      "Because I've had previous bad experiences with another bank and that was several years ago A friend recommended them and I have a home equity and checking I just like the service They've always treated me well My mother banks there she's a little elderly lady and they've always been helpful to her and that means a lot to me\n",
      "Because I've never had a problem with them or anything I think I was with Wells Fargo They did some shady [omitted] like not cashing my check until whenever so I had overdrafts with them I've never had that problem with MY BANK Every time you go in there there is somebody to help you right off There never seems to be a line It doesn't eat up a lot of your lunch hour I don't know I went through a divorce and I needed a lot of paperwork because I just paid my ex-wife directly I took money out of my account and put it directly into her account The State said I didn't pay her MY BANK gave me all of the paperwork to prove that I was paying her That saved me a lot in respect to the court battle and all that [omitted] I nipped that in the bud\n",
      "Because I've never had a question or problem they couldn't handle The way they treat people It feel's friendly\n",
      "Because my wife and I had had some financial difficulties a few years ago and they made us feel human They worked with us to help us get back on our feet The branch manager and the person downtown who did the loan did not look down at us They went out of their way to help us secure that small loan It's not so much MY BANK as it is the people at the branch that I go to I've been going to that branch for 25 years before it was acquired by MY BANK and they know you by name When you go in there they are never too busy to talk to you\n",
      "Because of the customer service and the satisfaction I get when I go in there It doesn't seem like a very big organization so when you make a call you just talk to one person and get what you need to know\n",
      "Because of the dealings I have had with the top person at that location I have had two others before They know the answers and how to get into the computers to get the information I need They waste no time and are accurate I am old and they are patient If I don't understand something I want to see it in black and white\n",

      "Because of their service their kindness and it is convenient for me They don't charge you for every little thing The bank I was with even if you breathed they would charge you They charged me for things that they shouldn't have I had to fuss with them and I thought \"Okay I've had enough of this\" Years ago my husband and I lived here and we moved away He was in construction and we banked with them when it used to be First Bank and now it's MY BANK We banked with them a long time until we moved away When I came back because he passed away I don't know why I stayed as long as I did with this other bank One day I had just had it They give very good service and like I said it is convenient for me too They don't have a lot of charges that this other bank had\n",
      "Because the employees are very friendly and knowledgeable The trainees are exceptional I'm very happy with them I feel very welcome and special when they call me by my first name Excellent customer service\n",
      "Because the level of customer service they know who we are I actually have another account at another bank and they joke around that they want the last account I'm impressed that they remember that I actually have my kids with MY BANK They go above and beyond for my business The atmosphere the way the step-up is open I feel like a person not just a number I'm actually impressed that they do their own customer surveys\n",
      "Because the people who work there are very open I moved to this bank because I'm happy with the service They inform me when they have specials and if I want to add more to my assets I do The manager there; I hope he stays there forever I just admire him As I told you the service is good and they have options if I need anything They inform me when they have special rates They keep me informed and that is what I need That bank always informs me\n",
      "Because the way they treat you they greet you You don't have to have a big bank account they're just nice to everybody I just like I went in the other day I haven't been in the new bank They treat me like when I visited Walmart Some banks don't recognize their customers My son is going to open a bank account They gave him good answers What else can I say about them?\n",
      "Because their tellers are very helpful and courteous It seems like I get a young lady named Carrie She's very sincere and courteous The girls over there are so nice and treat me so well I would never switch from MY BANK because of the customer service at Waynedale It's a little out of my way but I still wouldn't switch banks because of those girls They really deserve a pat on the back or an award I've been banking with them for a long time and I've never had a problem there Carrie treats me with some personal caring and consideration; they all are just caring I'm not wealthy but I think they would treat me the same as someone who is They take my banking seriously I wouldn't be surprised if I didn't get all excellent throughout the surveys\n",
      "Because they are always courteous to everyone I grew up in Kentucky and Indiana so I expect to be treated nicely You can ask them anything about the bank and if they don't know the answer they will get someone who can answer They greet you by name when you walk in and if you are waiting someone will come from the back counter to help you They make you feel like they want you at the bank and they treat you with absolute respect They call you by name they will help you and they are just very polite If they see you in the store they wave They are always so nice I know they have to deal with some very difficult people One of them a sibling of mine yells at them but they are so nice and kind to her I want to take her outside and whoop her for that She is very disrespectful yet they treat her like a little princess If you can treat someone who is as horrible as she is you are good!\n",
      "Because they are kind Because I'm old and they acknowledge me They know my dog's name This branch is my favorite but they're all good I have a cane and they suggested that I use an easier way to come in They suggested that to me I didn't know it was there  When I had my surgery I was not able to go to the bank I made arrangements to have all the business taken care of They went out of their way to help me\n",
      "Because they go above and beyond what's required they're very very friendly I think they're a smaller branch and because they're smaller you know them better than a larger branch I used to live in South Bend and I went to all different branches because I was driving all over; I guess that's probably why I didn't get to know them as well They're very personable They ask if you want a cup of coffee if the water's cold And it doesn't happen often but I have trouble with walking and if there are a couple of people in line they will ask me if I need to sit\n",
      "Because they greet me by name They treat me like a person not a number I don't like online banking or drive-thrus I deal with bankers in person I don't know how they do it; they greet me every time I come in the door I could not believe it the second trip there It's amazing A fantastic place I like the downtown branch as well Personally I don't believe in debit cards I guess I am just too old-fashioned There's just too much fraud going on I like to do my banking face-to-face I use checks I like the way that MY BANK operates and like doing my banking there very much They seem to be one of the most personable businesses that I do business with and are professional and friendly\n",

very sincere and courteous The girls over there are so nice and treat me so well I would never switch from MY BANK because of the customer service at Waynedale It's a little out of my way but I still wouldn't switch banks because of those girls They really deserve a pat on the back or an award I've been banking with them for a long time and I've never had a problem there Carrie treats me with some

what's required they're very very friendly I think they're a smaller branch and because they're smaller you know them better than a larger branch I used to live in South Bend and I went to all different branches because I was driving all over; I guess that's probably why I didn't get to know them as well They're very personable They ask if you want a cup of coffee if the water's cold And it
