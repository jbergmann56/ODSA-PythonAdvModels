They make you feel like they want you at the bank, and they treat you with absolute respect. They call you by name, they will help you, and they are just very polite. If they see you in the store, they wave. They are always so nice. I know they have to deal with some very difficult people. One of them, a sibling of mine, yells at them, but they are so nice and kind to her. I want to take her outside and whoop her for that.

They could clearly see that Amazon reversed that fee. So instead of saying that there is nothing that he could do for me and for me to handle it on my own, he could have said I see where Amazon corrected their mistake, it was your mistake nor ours so I will go ahead and reverse that fee for you, but no he told me there was nothing he could do and that I would have to fix it myself.

I woke up today, and there was $2,083.00 in my account. There should have been $83.00. It didn't belong to me. The teller made an error. I went into the branch, and talked to the manager. She said, ""Thank you for being honest."" That was a red flag for me. Now, I don't feel comfortable putting my money in that bank.",No,1

They do this for paper statements. If you have trouble on computers, they have nobody in three branches that can help you. Maple Lane, Grape Road, and Martins. Nobody can answer questions on how to bank online. I had two direct deposits in one account. To make one account free I had to move money. I deposited $10,000 a month and they still want to charge $5. I took a bank deposit from where I work at now, put it into my checkbook. On I have to transfer to pay my bills. I have a 60 year old account, and another for my expense money. I put that in my checkbook and pay my bills out of that checkbook once a month. So now, to make that checking account free, I had to move one of my direct deposited out of that. They don't have anybody in the bank to help with computerized banking or apps. You ask them questions and they have no answer. It's all the branches. I have been thinking about changing banks. I have two checkbooks of my own, I have a mortgage there, and my wife has a checkbook, we're thinking about moving them because I get better service out of Old National, and all I had there was a credit card. They just about got my business.",Yes,7
