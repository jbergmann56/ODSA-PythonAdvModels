908,Very prompt and friendly
909,We banked with three other banks and their service was very bad So we switched to MY BANK and their service has been the best
910,We done business for 50 plus years It's convenient to where we live I like the people They are friendly call you by name and we talk about things other than banking sometimes
911,We have banked there for a long period of time They are polite and friendly I am 100% satisfied I do not like the way they did the new structure in the building I have to be at a side position to the teller I do not like the side position I like to look at the teller face-to-face The personality of the people and the location I have never had an issue
912,We have banked with them for a long time There is always friendly and helpful people Easy access and closer to our home We've never had a problem
913,We have been dealing with Comcast Cable We have a few issues with them They need to go to the bank and get an education from the people there They do an excellent job They are close to home I am less than a mile from the office and they are handy They are excellent They do a good job They can't do any better than that I tell them that every time I walk out the door and they thank me for coming They just do a good job They are very professional They are just good people The interesting thing about it is the way they have changed the lobby and you can look at the computer and see what is going on It is always a pleasant visit I never walk out of there wondering if I did something wrong or if they gave me the wrong answers They are well-trained and interested in their customers
914,We have been with them for the early 1980s when it was OTHER BANK They go out of their way to be helpful and do what we need in the way of service We can't say enough good things about them
915,We have multiple accounts and business accounts I've just been doing work with money management and stock management and I've recently changed insurance through MY BANK And I'm in the process of refinancing our house
916,We love the location the hours and the employees We love the checking and if we were to open a new account it would be with them I like their customer service I like how they fill out the forms for me and all I have to do is sign them
917,We picked it because of the simplicity of the banking and because of the branch manager and the assistant branch manager Brittany came over and helped us when we initially walked in Stephany came over and called me by name so we liked that very much Brittany was the branch manager and Stephany was the assistant branch manager When we looked at the other banks they were very confusing We like the online capabilities and the online features for how we needed our accounts set up They were very very helpful
918,We were there at that bank when it was OTHER BANK Even when it was OTHER BANK we didn't have any problems I just retired sobeing in selling I got with customers who had different banks from all over and heard the problems they had We haven't had those problems I also have an account with Chase They had a nice program at Chase but when it came time to roll over my pension and IRA I chose MY BANK The banker was so wonderful When I left my job I had to retire earlier than I thought They put in a different retirement date My company was the one who messed up and the banker was so courteous He had to redo all the paperwork They were all so understanding and I tell people I send them to MY BANK not Chase If something comes up I don't go to my banker at Chase I go to MY BANK In my years of dealing with people and being out in the work force it was his professionalism and he took a personal interest He did everything he could do and above and beyond My company made the mistake It was such a mess yet he was so wonderful with it It was just great All of them the girls too They are always wonderful
919,Well because I've dealt with them for 40 years and I've always been happy I like all the people and I've never had any trouble I run several business through MY BANK and have never had any trouble
920,"Well just because of all the questions that I just answered ""excellent"" to for the bank The employees are very welcoming They are great people"
921,Well because I feel like family when I walk in there They are nice and helpful They even fill out all my deposit slips for me They are so helpful They are 100% because they are friendly and clean
922,Well because I just switched over I was a member of a credit union and everything they've done has been excellent They gave me my money early in December and now I can buy more Christmas presents Also the convenience of the branches They are all close to my house and you can even go while you're shopping in the Martins branch!
923,Well because it is very nice to walk in and they know who you are For instance I was using my savings account as a checking account They let me know that I was using a lot of money because I had an excess amount of withdrawals To be honest I don't think that anybody else would have brought that to my attention It's just nice that they know you When you walk in they acknowledge you If you have to wait you feel comfortable waiting
924,Well I had to change banks and I heard a lot about that bank because I live right across the street It's very close for me and a lot of people go there and I was told to go there I just opened my account there and it was so wonderful over there The girls; I didn't see too many men but it was excellent They were very very nice
925,Well I have been with them through all of the different phases I've been stuck with them forever They were First Federal and now they are MY BANK I will probably stay with them forever They have always treated us like family They know us when we go in and that's nice you know
926,Well I have never had any problem with them always been very helpful Very responsive when you have a question or need information I'm just very satisfied with them
927,Well I haven't personally explored any other companies I always rate MY BANK the best They are very polite and professional It's always easy to get in and out
928,Well I'm very satisfied with everything overall They are convenient I've dealt with them for years and never had any problems with them
929,Well it's because of all of the reasons we have talked about so far It was just the way we were treated when we set up our account there We liked their expertise The person who helped us out was very knowledgeable We are so glad that we opened up an account there
930,Well I've always had good service I just like the service They're always kind and helpful The only thing is there's no drive-thru in my area
931,Well number one the quality of people that work there The care they give to customers the friendliness and the accuracy We just wouldn't go anywhere else Well I don't even think about going anywhere else
932,Well they are friendly They know what they are talking about I have even spoke with the manager and she is intelligent with her work They are all really friendly They do not try and make you wait in line In fact that is something I have never had to do at MY BANK
933,Well they are the best I like the customer service They make me feel welcome
934,Well they greet you They are friendly speedy and they know what they are doing There are no long waits They recognize you if you have been in there before
935,Well they're knowledgeable They care about the customers and I've never had a problem with MY BANK They take care of whatever business I have I had in the past used it for a business account when I ran my own business and I've always had excellent service from MY BANK Well there are a lot of these big national banks that come in and then they leave And I don't trust them I trust MY BANK because they're local They understand the local people very good It's excellent I wouldn't go to any of the big national banks that come in and open up branches so I do business locally
936,We've been banking with them We have business there savings checking and we have been with them for years We just think they're the best bank around
937,We've had nothing but good service out of them Good people waiting on us They've always been very helpful We're very satisfied They're very personable people They're the best that we've found anywhere
938,When I go down there I know whatever I need they will do their best to help me with whatever I need help with I know them
939,When I go in there it feels really personal They talk to you they know my name everything there is fast I went to set up my account a few months ago and they were very quick with it very nice they even have cookies
940,When I go in there they take care of my business I needed to get some money out of my account and she grabbed the withdrawal slip and filled it out for me I get personalized service and they are always friendly
941,When I go in I get what I need They help me figure out what's going on with whatever I'm dealing with I've been with MY BANK for a while and I'm just happy
942,When I go there I get quality service I get what I need and when I ask for something I get what I want I like the promptness of the statements I think when I retire I'm going to put all my stuff over there
943,When I go there if I have questions they have the answers If I need to talk to someone they spend the time to talk to me It is super excellent Very friendly They always have time for you You never have to wait for anything I really like the bank MY BANK is like being at home for me They stand out
944,When I go to MY BANK I’m treated at as a valuable customer unlike another bank that my wife uses Any questions or problems I’ve had they go out of their way to help me They bend over backwards for the customers
945,When I got there I was shocked as to how nice the bank was and I was extremely happy with the service I didn't feel rushed They took their time with me and were very helpful
946,When I switched banks and I went there they were very friendly they knew my name and I consider them my friends They're always courteous and I can do transactions from the phone
947,When I was with OTHER BANK I had an issue with a particular check I got for the trust account and they decided on their own to send the check back to the writer without my knowledge Ever since that we pulled out everything from there into MY BANK and have been very happy We recommend the bank to our family
948,When you walk in it's the greeting taking time to explain really well Perfect Always comfortable I don't have to wait long Just great I can't say anything but they have the best of care and consideration Perfect bank to bank at
949,Where I work that's where we make our deposits daily Whenever I come in they're courteous prompt and take care of me right away They do a good job They take care of me If I have a question they can answer it When I opened my account I had some problems with the online banking so I went in and spoke to Rachel and she helped me out
950,Why? They just have great service hours and times I enjoy going in there
951,With all the above on the questions you asked and the business The personnel is friendly
952,You are treated well Everything works well You leave with a smile on your face They go above and beyond They are excellent nice people
953,You get to know the tellers and it's like seeing a friend Can't think of anything else
954,You get very good service there They're always polite and I've never had any troubles with them
955,You guys have excellent service Always friendly nice and professional I like your online service
956,You have that small-town feel I walk in the door and they address me by my first name They're extremely friendly I worked in retail for over 40 years and when you have that experience it makes you feel good all over
957,You touch on the name part I am always surprised that even new employees know my name even when I go there once or twice They are very accepting even when I was a young age and went in there I have a spouse who banks with a competing bank Chase and it seems that they have quotas to push other services than the one you went in there for They push walk-up deposits or other features or online things With the name part I thought it was kind of nice that they knew who I was I like to show my ID but at the same time it is nice that they know who I am
958,A couple of weeks ago the lady took forever I had to ring the bell I waited for four to five minutes She informed me that there were only two people there Then she left the window to do my transaction I got a deposit slip for the whole slip amount She didn't even look at my slip and then it took another five minutes to fix it She never offered an apology
959,"At the Dowagiac branch they are really rude They don't say ""Hi"" when you go in We have asked them for a loan and we never got help with that Yesterday I brought $22 in and she acted like she couldn't believe I had only $22 like she had to waste her time with $22 Every time I go in they act like they are irritated that they a have to deal with me When I went there yesterday they don't want to talk to you and they are short with you It's not like they say ""Hey how's your day?"" They don't make an effort to be hospitable I walked in and they didn't say anything and she knew I was there and didn't say anything to me I had to speak first They are not friendly I was standing there in silence We are switching banks because of that branch"
960,Because I don't have a computer and I don't have access to a computer so I always have to call my son if I have any questions about my account I don't think I should have to do that He's got an iPhone and he can tell me information about my account
961,Because I don't like the manager there She has been rude to me
962,Because I needed a print-out and I didn't feel I needed to pay $500 for it She told me that I could go online but not everybody is capable of going online
963,Because of the dark dirty alley where the drive-thru is located in and the poor access to the interior portion of the branch It's extremely dark in the alley for the drive-thru There are many people that will not even walk down that alley It needs more light It's not very welcoming from within your vehicle at all Most people would have a hard time turning down that alley like a soccer moms in a Tahoe They would avoid it I drive a pick-up I drive through very slowly and I drive for a living It's narrow and it has a very tight corner There is a pillar on your right that you’re turning around and one on the other side
964,Because they are not open on the weekends and I would like them to be open on the weekends
965,Before the other manager used to make me feel welcome Now it's not like that I don't feel welcome anymore
966,Drive-thru hours created difficulty for the business That is it
967,I expect personal service and I get none I have three accounts at the bank and the bank is totally unprepared to offer personal service I'm not asking for anything special I have had an account for over five years I work upstairs I walked into the bank with a check from my daughter for $12 and they wouldn't cash it I have over $3000 in my account
968,I had a mistake in my checking account They know I have two direct deposits every month I made a mistake with my account I had four checks that bounced and was charged fees for even though the bank knew I was going to have that money come in two days It ended up costing me $25000 altogether and I am not happy with the bank
969,I had some problems with the manager and another worker there They said that MY BANK would not cash my checks but I went to another MY BANK branch and they did cash the checks
970,I opened a title loan against a bike that was worth $3500 cash I brought it down I'm short $650 in funds I'm trying to fix this up I pulled the title loan out for $1500 That's all they would give me I went down to Spring Leads and pulled a personal loan for $3000 I've been paying promptly on time paying all my bills He didn't tell me the payments would be automatic either He said they would send a bill And they came out automatically so my wife had to pay for it
971,I went in with a situation that was not my fault or the banks fault Amazon took out money that they shouldn't have I talked with Amazon and they reversed the fee and the following day I got a overdraft fee So I went in and asked them to reverse the fee He told me that it was not our fault so you're going to have to call Amazon and get that handled yourself He then said that he would meet me half way with the fee but no I'm not meeting half way this was not my fault I find that inappropriate because it was not my fault nor their fault They could clearly see that Amazon reversed that fee So instead of saying that there is nothing that he could do for me and for me to handle it on my own he could have said I see where Amazon corrected their mistake it was your mistake nor ours so I will go ahead and reverse that fee for you but no he told me there was nothing he could do and that I would have to fix it myself I find that very unsatisfactory I've been a customer of theirs for ten years and I've had fees in the past and sucked it up and paid for it but this was not my fault He could see that he could also see that I deposited $600 the following day I just had a baby yesterday and everything counts Just for this reason I am already looking for a different bank which is sad because I've been a customer of MY BANK for ten years now I think that whole situation was the only thing I was dissatisfied with It's the way that whole thing played out and I feel like there was no understanding of the situation When it was clear and he wouldn't do anything it made me evaluate what bank I'm dealing with
972,I went in My mother has been with that bank for years and she passed away Now I have the account I wasn't aware that there was a $1500 charge for not having an automatic deposit I think that somebody who has had an account there for a long time should have received a courtesy refund of that charge
973,It was my fault with overdrawing on my account So I went back to pay a fee of $35 and I was short $061 and I had to drive back Kendallville I think the fees are becoming a nuisance and I am almost ready to go to another bank because of it
974,I've been banking with you guys for four and a half years and in the last nine months the wait for the drive-thru is so long I will reverse and put it in the drop box The wait is just so long I don't want to wait anymore
975,Like you said usually they will greet you by name That was never done I was with [employee name] and I told him my dad passed away and never got any condolences It's like it was a burden to them to have to take care of it [Employee name] said she can't cash the check for me and that I would have to go to another bank [Employee name] said he would be gone for a week and to come back in a week It was just weird why they wouldn't help me
976,My friend gave me a check and they wouldn't cash it for me They told me they had to put a two week hold on it I don't like that My other bank wouldn't do that
977,Online banking it's down sometimes
978,Switched to paperless statements and I had a $5 fee I needed them to fix that for me They checked my balance and I was refunded for the paper statements I wasn't supposed to get
979,That is the original branch where I opened my account years ago I take deposits from my business which is another bank and put it into my personal account at MY BANK That's how I pay myself my payroll when I deposit it and it's also signed by me That spooks most tellers that aren't familiar with my banking or me Often times if they apparently follow protocol they put the deposit on hold and I find it unacceptable
980,The customer service is okay I don't particularly care don't feel above and beyond that is my feeling don't care I go there for convenience I don't particularly care for that branch
981,The lack of customer courtesy; not being addressed and not being thanked for my business They just stand there and look at me and they don't say anything I don't like it when they put holds on my checks It's an inconvenience to me because I own a business and they put a hold on everything
982,The location is hard to get to There is no off-street parking you have to go in the garage It is not open on Saturday that's inconvenient
983,Well when I went in there to cash a check I have a mortgage They were more worried about if they could cash my check or not
984,$3600 for each mark If you overdraft there is a non-sufficient funds fee for each
985,A large deposit was deposited into the wrong account They took care of it right away
986,A letter I had recieved after I got back from Georgia and I called Donna and she's apparantly the manager The last time I got a loan I didn't need to have a debit card and checking account This time I needed a checking account and debit card and I really didn't want to do that but she made the decision that I have an active account that was why I came in and I didn't really want to The only thing was I was unsatisfied with was I had that open and she was the only one that could change it I do come in every month and I stay way ahead of my payment and she made the decision
987,A lot of turnover in the employees recently it seems
988,A new teller put a deposit into the wrong account It was my account just the wrong account of mine
989,Apparently something about the bank cards you guys had breaches When I went to get groceries it was declined and I had to leave the grocery line looking like I was poor
990,At the Dowagiac branch you can't deposit money in the ATM It's archaic And you can't put money in I can't put money in the machine If I want to deposit and the bank is closed I have to go to Niles a whole different town If I stop banking with you that would be the reason why because I want to use an ATM whenever I need it That's why there are ATMs The branches say they're not allowed to put signs on the ATMs when they're offline That would help so people don't wait in line to pull up to a machine only to find out it's not working I experienced that at the Niles branch
991,Cashing of a payroll check issued at MY BANK; the required documents You need a driver's license and you need another form of ID You couldn't use your social security card
992,Communication; not at the branch but with the documentation of my loan and what was required
993,Depositing funds into the wrong account Getting charged fees that weren't due to me When I put cash in the bank its not available right away
994,Does not have a public restroom
995,Ever since I have been here I have never been able to get a free money order or bank check At another bank branch they knew me and did not charge me for money orders or bank checks I would like to see that done here after they get to know you I don't ask very often
996,Every time we use our debit card someone gets our information and tries to run up charges
997,For some reason my deposit in my checking account wasn't properly done They were having trouble with the one and the seven in my checking account number
998,Had a problem with the deposit and it was near tax season
999,Having been a customer at that branch for 28 years every time they ask me for my ID when I am going through the drive-thru or even in the store They need to put my ID on the computer so when it comes up they have my picture Other banks do it They say that they do not have the technology That is concerning Or put cameras in the drive-thru so I show my driver’s license and will not have to send it through I will never send my driver’s license through because they lost it once
1000,I added someone to my card When they activated their card it deactivated my card I fixed it over the phone
1001,I almost closed my MY BANK credit card I went to Oklahoma and called the credit card and said I was going there so I could use my card The first time I used it I went to a 7-11 It always charges $1 and it thought it was fraud so I had to use another card I called and said it was okay The card never left my person it was me I thought it was fixed I used it again same thing at a furniture store They said I needed to change the number on my card but there was no reason to I came back and they changed the card without my knowledge I got it in the mail and I was mad I had to call everyone I had debits with and change all the stuff I was really angry I know they were trying to protect me It was embarrassing I was really hacked I was so angry and I don't use it as much now I only use it for groceries I use my Chase card more What made me the maddest was that they did it without telling me I got no call letter or anything telling me they were going to do that At least I could have had some warning That was embarrassing I like MY BANK but that really hacked me I hope they don't do it again or I am closing it Never had a problem other than that
1002,I always go to Covington because it's more convenient When I go to the ATM I've noticed that it's been unavailable several times I also think they made some changes with the ATM They haven't really changed everything but for a lot of things you can't just; you have to go through another process I just think that the ATM isn't updated
1003,I am a new student in the country and I opened a new account I didn't have access to funds accounts or the card for the first few weeks It took me so long to get everything set up The waiting time for them to get the online banking registration set up
1004,I am self employed and get checks or payments made out to me and or my business Sometimes they won't cash it for me or put it in my savings I would rather have one checking and one savings account instead of four two business accounts also
1005,I been dealing with MY BANK for a long time My social security check goes in I went in to get the $1000 loan and I was denied Every time I try to get a loan I get denied $1867 month and not able to give me a loan due to pass credit problems I was able to get four credit cards from other banks but MY BANK doesn't trust to give me a loan for $1000
1006,I bought gasoline at a place an hour away from my house I used my MY BANK debit card It went through no problem I drove home and I drove to a Taco Bell five minutes away from my house They denied my card for a $6 order I called and they said I was not close enough to my house They let me buy $50 worth of gas an hour away and then they wouldn't let me buy $6 worth of Taco Bell five minutes away That's my only problem with them
1007,I called them It said I had a deposit of $0 I asked if it was IRS or fraud I had keep pressing them to find out The person on the phone was not helpful and I asked to speak to someone else I was put on hold then it took 20 minutes to get my answers
1008,I can't log on to online banking They changed how I log on and I can't remember my username It was making me get a code number every time I logged on
1009,I closed on a house in October The first insurance company refused to cover house and I learned three months after close that it came through MY BANK I received another insurance which was a wonderful mortgage They did not refund the first escrow check from first five visits to two different banks The insurance company had a check The branch manager is the one that placed the phone call that should have been done in the first place In the first bank she said the check would be issued No one was willing to take ownership and the woman at Center Street did what she thought was best There was over $700 sitting out there that I never received Everyone has been kind and nice They should get nice remarks When I deposited $3000 into my checking account for whatever reason the branch refused to release the money The representative of Center Street called me at home that the system was to be back up I had to call my broker to make sure the check was good That was offensive They have had nine months to see if the check was to clear That is insulting I am on disability income They have had nine months Very insulting [Employee name] who runs the mortgage branch wrote an obnoxious letter that the account would be debited without my yes or no if the mortgage was not paid The letter was poorly written and did not reflect the change of the bank That letter has to be pulled and written with concept They should have good faith that the person who bought the house is going to pay
1010,I couldn't revisit my account online
1011,I deposited my check at 7:30 am The system put a hold on my money which was unacceptable When I looked at my receipt it showed when it would be available I was very upset and the teller couldn't tell me why the system did it automatically And she couldn't override it Later the excuse they gave me was that there had been a lot of frauds so that's why their system did that
1012,I did a transfer on my phone app and it wasn't recorded
1013,I did not care the way that you stand beside the teller now
1014,I did not understand I have an account but according to the government and their rules you cannot make more than six withdrawals out of this special account I went over that I guess I didn't realize that I couldn't do that so I received some letters thanking me for my business This didn't come from Eric the banker I spoke with but we did discuss it I don't know what else you want me to say
1015,I didn't get my debit card yet
1016,I didn't have access to my accounts because of a power outage it was down for a while I think that it was an act of God or something I was trying to do online banking and transfer funds to my daughter's account and I couldn't
1017,I don't like your drive-thru cash location It's too low I have complained a couple of times I have to get down out of my SUV truck and get down on my knees to get the cash out
1018,I don't want my name coming up on that [omitted] ATM screen
1019,I experienced kind of a long time processing checks When I called the downtown branch where I thought I left the check I thought that is where I was supposed to call The lady was rude I forgot if that was where I called and she was very nasty So when you called The North Anthony branch they are always very nice there My whole family banks there They are very nice
1020,I felt that I was harassed about a visit that I made I wasn't greeted with a smile and the teller wasn't cordial or friendly I didn't feel comfortable when I went to go make a transaction it was almost like I was being harassed
1021,I guess they were having computer problems They were delaying everything It took 25 minutes to get through It just took a long time to fix it That was the only bad time I've ever had
1022,I had a balance discrepancy in my checking account and I went to one branch to ask about it They gave me the wrong information  so I went to another branch and they were able to help me out They got me the right answer I had to go from the far North side of town to the far South side of town to get the information
1023,I had a deposit made in my account that was not mine They handled it in a timely manner This happened on the 18th and now the deposited amount is in the correct account
1024,I had a discrepancy on my account with my debit card There was an amount removed without my approval I called the 1-800 number and that lady was really helpful She canceled my card The lady on the phone helped me more than the gentleman at the bank did I found out that Portage Avenue took money out of my account not just one time but twice The guy at the bank gave me a copy of the rights of the company that took the money from me The company refunded all of the money they took from me The manager Solomon didn't really want to help I felt like he didn't believe me He didn't take it very seriously I'm very careful with my checking account and I would never agree to anyone taking out money This was a large amount of money and he didn't seem to take it as seriously as I did That's how he came across At the time when he told me who it was I couldn't remember Once I did some research I found out who it was I took a letter to him and I explained it to him again He called and said there was nothing he could do He could only give me the rights and responsibilities from that company
1025,I had a problem with a savings account and it was compromised Andrea handled it very well and took care of it for me
1026,I had an issues where my card was stolen It was on a Sunday and no one was available It's a lousy feeling The fraud department contacted me but there was no live person for me to speak with
1027,I had checks for a line of credit and someone got into my account I don't know how they got into my account
1028,I had foot surgery and was on a crutch And no one offered me a chair during the wait for the teller
1029,I had money stolen from my account and they were working with me to get it back but it turns out that they cannot
1030,I had opened an investment savings account I was told that as long as I had $25000 combined I would not get charged service fees I asked for the service fees to be refunded I told them that I wanted to be refunded my service fees or I would close my account I was told that another branch was going to call me but they have not contacted me The teller who assisted me; she did everything she could
1031,I had overdrafts for two different items and they charged me $3600 for each I called them and they said they would take one away The next day they charged two more overdrafts I did call back after that
1032,I had problems setting up a savings account
1033,I had some problems with my checking account I was charged $075 for each check I used If I put $50000 in my checking account the fee is waived However I was told that policy was terminated So I went to go close my account and that teller told me that the policy did not change She gave me a brochure and I kept my account open
1034,I had someone hack my checking account and they called me the bank did And asked me if I authorized a purchase in Germany and they took care of it
1035,I had to go into the Bremen branch It seemed that a teller at the Fort Wayne branch; some gal went in to make a withdrawal and the teller used my number I found out on the internet and the amount was for $73800 They pulled it out of her account and gave me my money back I think they should give me $3000 or the teller should give me $3000 instead of charging me an overdraft fee
1036,I have a personal loan with MY BANK I paid more in interest this month compared to last month The branch manager has no clue how a simple loan works I talked to two branch managers She didn't want to explain to me
1037,I have a small business account there and just in the last month I'm not able to balance my transactions It's frustrating to me that I can't do that
1038,I have a small business I applied for a line of credit and they lost my paperwork I hadn't heard anything for almost a month so I called last week Yesterday the manager called me back and he said they are trying to track it down but they haven't found my paperwork yet He did ask if I wanted to resubmit my paperwork and I think I am going to I just couldn't do it yesterday I talked to Eric and the branch manager and they both have been helpful
1039,I haven't been able to log into my account We've been having issues they couldn't figure it out When they logged into their office it worked I don't know if it's on my end or their end
1040,I just don't like my checks being held until the next morning to have my money
1041,I made a payment in Columbia City The next day an employee called and told me in a very rude manner that I needed to make a payment now She basically called me a liar The payment had been made Finally I hung up on the employee
1042,I misunderstood the level of balance when I went under the level  After discussing it with them they reversed the fees
1043,I ordered checkbooks twice and they were never available They said I did not have the correct address but I had an updated address with them
1044,I ordered checks and I still haven't received them It's been at least 20 days They were lost in the mail and we still haven't gotten them She reordered them on Friday Nothing
1045,I ordered checks and they came in the wrong color And I have two checking accounts so now I have two of the same color for the different accounts
1046,I sent the stuff through the tube and she asked what to do with it I said I wanted to cash it She must have gotten distracted or something because she asked me again what I wanted to do with this I said cash it then she said that I had to send it I already did it was in front of her Oh my gosh I don't know where this lady came from but she asked again what I wanted to do with it Then she asked if I wanted to deposit it I said I wanted to cash it I just looked at my friend that was with me She was not friendly or nice and did finally complete the transaction She was not paying attention How could she not have known it was there? I had to tell several times that I wanted to cash it
1047,I set up multiple accounts and they wanted to link them with internet access
1048,I signed up for e-statements but I ended up getting charged for paper statements It was promptly fixed when I saw that it happened I got charged more than one time I went in and talked to Stephanie and I got half of my money back She knew I signed up for it because she set up my account I know she emailed somebody and then shortly after that I got my refund The ladies there are amazing I've been there since I was a little kid I always get my problems taken care of
1049,I spend a lot of my time outside the US Teaching in China I'm only back in the country for about six months The frustrating thing about it is the security when I visit another country Notices get rejected and my account gets closed down and hard to open again Especially from a non US number
1050,I talked to Eric at the desk He told me one thing Chantell on Saturday set me up with something else They are very nice but haven't been very helpful to me I have not had any problems in the past until the last few weeks
1051,I told you I couldn't get in my bank account I took my wife's card and the ATM didn't work and I couldn't get the money out! It breaks down too much! Also the sun glares off of it in the evening and you can't see it They need to move it I was pretty mad! I have to get out of the car to see it in the evening They need something over the top I had a real big problem with that I had to go to the next bank and had to pay $3! The ATM is down at least once a month It also needs to be moved because it is not good where it's located That's all You've got to fix that to where you can see it Otherwise I didn't have any problem
1052,I transferred funds into my son's account and he ended up getting an overdraft I don't know what happened
1053,I tried to enroll in e-mail statements and switch from paper statements I did it right There was something that didn't go through on the website They reimbursed me for what I was charged They fixed it and I haven't had a problem since
1054,I tried to sign up for mobile deposit and I was denied I'm a new customer
1055,I wanted to deposit a $1000 check and when I went in there the line was about ten feet long I waited 20 minutes After 20 minutes the line was still 10 feet long You had loan officers sitting in their offices You had one teller at the front and you had another teller that was trying to help out She would come out try to help and then hurry back to the drive-thru I went over to MY BANK on Martin's at Gumwood to complete my transaction
1056,I wanted to do online banking and so I was online on the MY BANK website They turned me down They wouldn't let me do the online banking It was something like my husband was the main account holder but both of our names are on the account We both deposit and have names on the account so I was a little irritated My name is on the account and I don't have access to the online account I deposit I don't see why I was denied to do the online banking
1057,I wanted to sign up for online banking and I couldn't do it
1058,I was asking for a new card It was supposed to take four days and it took a week
1059,I was charged for statements I had signed up for e-statements and I was still being charged
1060,I was rounding up my payment and they did not apply the additional payment to the principle
1061,I was there this afternoon to do a personal mobile deposit It was a Department of Revenue check The branch manager Kathy asked Stephanie to call customer service to make sure we could properly do the endorsement of the deposit in the mobile app Stephanie called to check if this would be okay without a signature; they were told by customer service that yes there would be no problem with that I deposited the check at 2:56 pm I got home at 3:08 pm to get a notification that no it had been deleted because of the endorsement I'm happy with these girls at the branch They did nothing wrong They did everything right Someone in customer service got wires crossed and they weren't giving accurate information or somebody else wasn't So I will have to make another trip back there tomorrow The fault is totally with customer service not with the tellers or the administrators at the branch bank
1062,I was trying to get information on my new home mortgage loan to see if it was an auto draw and they got back to me on the day after the automatic draw so I had an overdraft charge They had phone problems They were not able to connect me to the right people It was actually technical problems that caused the delay
1063,I was using my company's credit card and I had money in the bank but it wouldn't let me make a purchase This happened two days ago That was it
1064,I went in and the tellers were rude
1065,I went in and none of the regular tellers were there Nobody knew who I was and it was somewhat bothersome
1066,I went to close my account I get a note that I get a $5 charge for paper statement
1067,I went to deposit money in the bank I asked the teller exactly how much money; I wanted to know how much money I had in the bank because I had to go to the pharmacy to fill a prescription She told me that I had $17000 in the bank When I went to the pharmacy they said I was overdrawn
1068,I went to the Bremen branch to cash a payroll check [Employee name] gave me [omitted] for not filling out a deposit slip and then she gave me [omitted] for not having direct deposit I hardly ever use the Bremen branch I walk into the Nappanee branch and the women know me Matter of fact I went in there to make a withdrawal Truth be told I'm not going to be using the Bremen branch anymore
1069,I went to the store right after I went through the drive-thru and my card was declined If I had known that my money wouldn't go into my account immediately I probably would have gotten cash There was a long line of people staring when my card was declined and they thought I didn't have the money I wish I had known if it was a policy that the money doesn't go in right away
1070,I would like to know why I get social security When I'm banking at my other bank they put it in the day before that way the money was always there the day before the due date I get it on the third Wednesday of the month
1071,I wrote a check on the wrong bill used the wrong check to pay a bill and they let my account go over drawn over $200 I thought they should have given me a call and let me know I only found out because I checked and they charged me the fee every day for that account being overdrawn and no one called The check was $87 and the rest of my money was ate up in fees over that one check
1072,I'd like to be able to make mobile deposits
1073,I'd like to be able to but I can't think of the name of it I'm sorry I'm not the person to talk to about this My daughter would know but I can't think of the name of it What is it that you have to have to change something? We had problems with the power of attorney The main bank downtown would not accept the power of attorney to take her name off of the checks and that It was nobody from Maple Lane when we ran into that problem We ran into that problem when we called downtown The downtown office wouldn't accept the power of attorney
1074,If I don't deposit enough they charge me a fee I've asked for online statements but I can't seem to get my computer right to get them It just makes me want to switch banks
1075,If I go into my computer and change my history delete my history when I go in to use the online system it pops up some code I have to put in I really hate having to do that it's a waste of my time I hate make work things
1076,I'm a small business owner and I've been going there and never had a bad check from there And I can never cash a check and get money back The one on Coventry sucks They just want to hold my money hostage I'm clearly putting money into this bank and they still don't want to cash my checks so I am almost in the process of getting rid of them I get charged 30 dollar withdrawals also But they should know me by now They must be broke because they are really scared to lose any money
1077,I'm trying to get a new card I had a name change because of marriage and I thought I had it taken care of That was the reason of my last visit to the branch I still haven't received the card in the mail I'm beginning to wonder if I'm going to get it
1078,Issue with debit card at ATM Actually it was an issue with the PIN  at the ATM
1079,Issues with my statements not being delivered I wanted paper statements They didn't send them and then they did It was just the confusion with that and also with the telephone People were not helpful when I called
1080,It could've been my fault I had set up an account I had one checking account transferring money to another checking account It transferred money when I didn't have enough funds to transfer causing an overdraft on one of the accounts I owed them money
1081,It had to do with online banking and I ended up having to call in because the transaction wasn't being processed
1082,It had to do with their checking They said that I had overdraft protection It only worked with my credit card not my checks When I signed up for it they told me it would work for both
1083,It happened at another location Something about my last name is not the same in all my documents so it's hard for them to find my account every time They said that they were going to fix it They hadn't yet the last time I was there
1084,It has happened twice I had a payment that I made to another bank and according to my bank they didn't use the internet they used the checking Otherwise when I made it from the internet it didn't really go through when they were supposed to get it They told me that it was about the check I'm also trying to figure out what is going on at MY BANK about what is going on about what I needed to know about this payment I finally talked to a manager and she said that it was a policy issue about the deposit slip
1085,It takes too long for things to post to my account like my deposits and withdrawals
1086,It took an hour for them to print out a treasurer's check because of upgrades to the computer system
1087,It was about a month ago I went to the drive-thru I sat there for about 20 minutes for a deposit receipt I was the only one there The other day I went in there to close my HSA It was supposed to be a confidential meeting They had me in the lobby They were asking personal questions and I didn't feel comfortable
1088,It was during when they were giving money to charity I wasn't too pleased with that because they could've dispersed that to the customers and not to charity I feel that we are faithful customers and MY BANK isn't doing anything with their reward money
1089,"It was in regards to cashing a check that was for two names with an ""or"" in the name It was for an adult's name a guardian unless the person was over 21 He was well over 21 and they wouldn't let him cash it It was a real hassle"
1090,It was just related to the down time for the website It was down so I couldn't transfer money over a couple of times in the past three months
1091,It was minor they fixed it before anything had happened I think it was a wrong amount returned in cash back He received too much and took it out of his checking account
1092,It was over some temporary checks I received the wrong ones and then there were some fees applied but they took care of it
1093,It was the ATM I went to the ATM three times and it was out of service It was 10 days later before they gave me the money back and then some You guys gave me the money back at the Dowagiac branch The teller called and told me that the bank was giving my money back; it was awesome I just want to say that MY BANK takes care of their own
1094,It was the former manager that they transferred to the new branch on Illinois Road She wasn't a very good manager; not helpful My nice comments didn't include her Everyone else is great
1095,It was three minutes before she came to the teller window I didn't see her helping someone else in there When she came back I made a comment about her being locked in the vault I gave her my stuff and told her I wanted my balance When I looked up she was gone and someone else was there They helped the other person who came in after me first 
1096,It was when I tried to spend more money than my bank would allow I am allowed an amount I can spend per day I exceeded that amount They said it was taken care of and it was not It took 24 hours to get it taken care of and I had to get angry The local branches are good but the South Bend office could not do it
1097,It was with my bank card I was having problems I went to the gas station to get gas on a Friday like every Friday and my card was denied They locked my card Then after I talked to the lady she said it was an unusual purchase So she fixed it I thought and on my way home I went to get something to eat for my family and it was being denied I tried several times and I was on the phone with the lady and she had to try several times to figure out what was wrong Finally I was about to leave and the manager of the food place paid for my food that night because I was having so many problems with my card That's actually why I went to the Columbia City branch I went to cancel that card and get a new card with a new number reissued 
1098,It's the branch on Coldwater Rd I am unsatisfied with the customer service I do all my banking through the phone since I moved I have had multiple mistakes at the Coldwater branch
1099,It's with Winamac branch in Winamac Indiana It's a particular teller she's overbearing She's probably in some fashion skirts around some of the confidentiality rules to banking I've brought this up before The Cascada branch couldn't be more exceptional The Winamac is 180 degrees the opposite I have quite a bit of experience with that bank because I used to live there It's just a coincidence that I had a problem there a couple of weeks ago Two or three weeks ago Claudia she's been there for a long time I think when you're talking about putting discretion in a bank she crosses the line I don't want to make it dramatic or subjective this has been a historical problem with Claudia I try not to do any banking with Winamac I have times I have to bank there I do 90% of my banking with Cascada They couldn't be more professional or courteous I can't emphasize that enough They could learn a lot about best practices by going to Cascada
1100,I've banked with them for centuries and now to think that if I don't open an account online I get charged for checking is [omitted] I think it's ridiculous I opened this because my wife was head of the city stuff at Elkhart and they recommended MY BANK highly years ago So now I'm paying $3000 for checks and it used to be free checking This sheds no light on the people at Martin's at all but I am just upset about the whole situation
1101,I've had problems with their website and trying to do online banking I always use the same computer and every time I use the computer it acts as if it's a new computer and I have to get a one-time passcode emailed to me It asks me if I want to register it and I always say yes but when I go to use it again it's the same story
1102,Lack of information on the part of the teller They have a $500 fee for a certain savings account and the teller wasn't aware of it I am due a reimbursement the next time I go to the bank
1103,Late fees for mobile deposits When I got my debit card I didn't have a PIN number You can't deposit cash in the ATMs
1104,Me and my daughter went into the bank to take my name off her account because she just got married and we needed a new bank card  We still haven't gotten the card They haven't done anything they said they were going to do We wanted to change the savings account and change it into a checking account and they still haven't done that My daughter Jessica filled out all they paperwork and they still haven't done anything They said they would do some investigating and they still haven't gotten back to me This is the second time My other daughter went through the same thing and it took them a while before she got her card
1105,My ATM check card expired at the end of March I did not receive my new card It was shipped to an address that had been closed for like six or seven years so that was where they sent it to I tried to activate it over the phone It was activated so after I tried to use it at an ATM It stated it was declined so I had to go into the branch They called South Bend and they had to do something to get it to work
1106,My bank card number got stolen and used
1107,My card got frozen it was the activity I had to call to verify it wasn't fraud activity It was a good thing
1108,My error for not using the register I depend on online banking I don't like ATMs
1109,My e-statements didn't go through I didn't put any money in my account so my account went dormant
1110,My mother has an account with them and so do I and for some reason they linked my account to hers 
1111,My mother passed away at the end of March and I wanted to verify her account and it was a time that her pension and social security was to come in and also a supplemental health care which would have been automatic I was charged 35 dollars for a stop payment which was not told to me They actually suggested doing it but then when  I saw my statement they charged and I really didn't need to do it
1112,"My old bank use to show the total amount after I would make a deposit It would show the total before the deposit and the total after the deposit and now I have to ask for the total Even if they put the total after the deposit that would be ok but they don't So now I have to ask them ""what's in my account now?"" The receipt just shows the deposit I would like to see my present total or the total after the deposit"
1113,My savings account was closed and I wasn't sure why They explained why and gave me a solution I could open another savings account or open another checking account that would make things easier None really I received great service
1114,Non-MY BANK ATM fees rub me wrong
1115,Okay I just did
1116,Only the mobile deposit product that I can't seem to make work
1117,Our account got hacked It wasn't due to anything just a computer or security glitch They took care of it right away and replaced our debit card We've had no problems since
1118,Overdrawn and I wasn't overdrawn They straightened it out but I had to get angry to get it done
1119,Password Just cannot get together on the password
1120,Problems with the computer system I had gone in there because there was an issue with security with my account
1121,Signed up to receive a debit card and have not received it yet
1122,Someone attempted to use my card and took $75 but MY BANK caught it immediately and contacted me
1123,Someone hacked into my account and tried to buy makeup and they had to change my account number and debit card It wasn't the bank's fault Someone hacked it
1124,Sometimes my checks don't go through but that's probably because of the company that I work for
1125,"Sometimes the security is over the top I may have made a couple of transactions that may have been considered ""strange"" at a gas station or coffee house I don't see how they were strange but they froze my account or something My card wouldn't work after that Also not letting me know that my check would not be available until the next day They should have said something like ""The cash will not be available until the next day"""
1126,Stephanie's not there She was the bank manager and I couldn't have asked for a more exceptional person
1127,The account is a non-profit They wanted the exempt number and I can't get that We are under another group's umbrella and they won't give me the number I am still not online I just want to be able to see if a check is cleared I don't want to be charged for a bank statement which so far they haven't done I wish I could get it straightened out As long as they don't charge me $500 per month like they said they would So I don't mind if they don't charge
1128,The account that I have charges for what I have added and extended something that I don't need I also had a problem with my login
1129,The ATM didn't dispense the right amount of money It seems that a lot of the time it doesn't work
1130,The ATM wasn't working
1131,The ATMs are down too often
1132,The ATMs are out of order The last few months it's been that way
1133,The banker and myself are trying to get me off of paper statements and we can't figure it out We keep trying to go in and change it but it won't work
1134,The Cleveland branch; I wasn't handled in a courteous manner I was not satisfied
1135,The downloadable app would not load right
1136,The drive-up windows are inaccessible because of my handicap I have to get out of the car in order to use them and it is very difficult and hard to do that I needed to have coins counted so I had to go around and go inside They do not have a coin counter there I had to take everything back and go to the MY BANK in Covington
1137,The first problem is that this is the only branch that I'm near to and it doesn't have an ATM and isn't open on Saturday's It's the only branch in town The second problem: I feel that the overdraft policy is a little strict I made a payment a day after the account was overdrawn and got a $3000 fee that I didn't know about It would be nice to have at least a one-day Grace period if your account goes over It just seems pretty strict
1138,The lady that waited on me was the branch manager She deposited my money and wasn't listening when I told her how I wanted it When I ordered my merchandise I didn't have any money so then I went down to the bank She told me that she explained to me the way that she had put my money in my account which she did not and I was very upset

1140,The minimum balance for a savings account is $30000 I would like it to be $5000 There is a certain time period like 45 days if I want to open a savings account I want it to be $5000 The fact that they say I have to keep $30000 in there means they are losing business because of that I can open a checking account for nothing I want to open a savings account I shouldn't have to keep $30000 in there $5000; that's it It's deterring people from opening savings accounts
1141,The mobile app for the bank I had problems but it has since been fixed within the past two months
1142,The most convenient branch to me is the new branch in Ft Wayne and the ATM machine is set too low In order to use it I have to get out of my vehicle If the sun is just right I have to get on my knees to conduct my transaction which is kind of ridiculous when the temperature outside is below freezing Otherwise that's a great branch
1143,The one down here on Bristol Street is a regular standing bank When I went there the tellers were not friendly at all The tellers need to have more friendly customer service That was about it really They don't say hi and ask how I am They don't ask to help with anything else They were professional but their customer service needs something
1144,The one out on Island Road my experience was awful and I called them and told them about it

1150,The teller didn't have a roll of quarters Yet both the other tellers and the manager I guess were occupied So I waited several minutes I would suggest that the tellers have rolled coins at their stations all the time Other than that I think they're excellent

1156,There is one teller who acts like you are bothering her She is not friendly She is rude Say you want to make a deposit (and I've been a customer there for a while)and you have $80 and you want to deposit $70 and you ask her for change so you can make the correct deposit Even though she knows us she will not give us change We have to put the entire amount in She will not look our account up if I don't have it with me The manager is fantastic and I love the bank very much I'd rather not say her name because I don't want to be pointing a finger I would guess they can figure it out on their own She just has a sour disposition No I don't
1157,There was a fraud problem and I wanted to change my card number I went to the bank and they told me to wait a couple of days I am really uncomfortable with using cash I went to the bank two days ago They told me that they are going to make a new card number for me and that I will have to wait a couple more days

1160,There's a particular employee that overly talks and you can't get out of the bank They talk about personal things It can be uncomfortable It's happened a couple times I don't go inside the bank any more

1172,They shut down my card when I went to Canada but I didn't let them know when I was going
1173,They started asking for you to write your account number on the back of checks instead of just sending your ID in It's an extra step that is not needed
1174,This is the drive-thru window I drove up and the green light was on I sat waiting assuming that the window was open and that there were tellers inside I waited for quite a little while I decided to pull around and went inside I mentioned to the teller that there was a wait to no response I did get a very thoughtful apology without a reason for the wait

1181,We lost our old card and we talked to a man to get a new one within seven to ten days and we haven't received it yet
1182,We made out five deposit slips for five checks and she only got one receipt through the drive-thru She went inside to check on it and the teller was very irritated Usually we get a deposit slip for each check because we have a small business and it gives us a better record of each job
1183,We run a small business and we have multiple accounts The problem we have is that they put money into different accounts I've asked them to put money in my personal account and they put it into my business account instead They just don't pay attention They never look at the back of the check We have to go online to transfer it
1184,We went through the drive-thru and we made a payment on our home equity The teller sent back one receipt for the amount which was placed on the principal The next month we got a $1300 charge for a late payment It was a coding error by the teller We received a letter saying that it was their error so that we would have it for credit reference in the future
